# Disaster Safety Android Application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC IDEA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic idea of the android application we are going to make is that 
users will be able to get notifications at the time of any calamity like
earthquakes, floods and hurricanes by getting alerts from anyone who gets
to know of the calamity quickly by getting a notification in the form of
images posted online or any common text broadcasts according to their 
location.In addition to this , in the case of earthquake, our application
will make use of the gyroscopic sensor and accelerometer of the smartphone of the user according
to the time duration of random vibrations sensed in a continuous period of time.
Once the user is informed of the calamity, the user follows the emergency steps to be 
taken during the time of the calamity.We also incorporate government agencies 
to notify in case of a hurricane or flood beforehand through the application 
and also provide various fast access emergency numbers in the application.
Our idea stems from the fact that when a calamity comes, it is the people near 
the calamity area that get notified of the calamity first, not the news channels, so 
therefore through the means of the common people we notify all others in the 
surrounding areas to act accordingly.We also take help from the government 
agencies who can create a special account in our application to specifically
notify in case of an incoming danger.    

In all, the alertness and conciousness of the people and government agencies 
near the calamity area can help to broadcast the calamities like hurricanes and
floods while earthquakes can also be known of by the same alongwith the help of the 
gyroscopic sensor and accelerometer in a smartphone.

DETAILS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EARTHQUAKE

  - Our application will take help of the gyroscopic and various required sensors of the
    smartphone to sense a randomized set of vibrations for a abnormally long period of time like
    3-4 seconds and then accordingly notify the user of the earthquake.
    
  - The application then gives all the precautions to be taken by the user during the time of the 
    calamity like:-
    
            --Vacate to an open area alongwith anyone who is surrounding you.
            
            --Call government emergency numbers like ambulance, fire brigade,etc.
            
            --Call and warn dear ones who may be near you.
### FLOOD

  - Our application will take help of the people around the flood area to notify them either by taking 
    images or by broadcasting alerts to the nearby people to take precautionary measures and also to 
    notify the people and government to unblock/open as many possible draining or sewage systems as 
    possible.
    
  - The application then gives all the precautions to be taken by the user during the time of the 
    calamity like:- 
    
            --Vacate to places where water cannot stay easily like high rise buildings or open fields.
            
            --Call government emergency numbers like ambulance, etc.
            
            --Call and warn dear ones who may be near you.
            
            --Open as many unclosed sewage and drainage systems as possible in the surrounding area.
            
            --Wear air jackets so that no one drowns.
            
### HURRICANE

  - Our application will take help of the government agencies and common people near the calamity area 
    to notify them in case of incoming hurricane situations.
  - The application then gives all the precautions to be taken by the user during the time of the 
    calamity like:-
    
            --Vacate to a building alongwith anyone who is surrounding you.
            
            --Call government emergency numbers like ambulance, fire brigade,etc.
